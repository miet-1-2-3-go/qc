## Qiskit

### 1.1 What is Qiskit?

Released by IBM Research in 2017, Qiskit provides tools for creating and executing quantum algorithms at varying levels. It aims to make programming quantum computers accessible to broader audiences beyond just physicists.

At its core, Qiskit enables composing, executing and optimizing quantum programs with clarity. It provides an intuitive way to build algorithms from low-level quantum operations all the way up to complex applications. This is accomplished through a modular, circuit-based paradigm representing workflows.

Qiskitâ€™s hardware-agnostic circuit representation ensures that developed quantum code can run across different physical machines. Whether using an IBM Quantum system, ion traps or newer technologies, flexibility is baked in. Capabilities also extend to simulation, education and research thanks to Aer elements providing blazing-fast simulators for debugging without hardware access.
